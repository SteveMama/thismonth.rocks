Pomodoro is a method of working in 25 minute segments. 

<br> 

It makes you aware of the time in a day and it prevents you from getting stuck in
a rabbit hole. There's a great video on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFW3Ld7JO0w) and
a small course can be found [here](https://calmcode.io/pomodoro/introduction.html).

<br> 

There's great apps that you can download but the most popular one
seems to be [tomighty](https://tomighty.github.io/). If you're interested
in knowing more behind the theory behind it you might appreciate 
reading [the book](https://francescocirillo.com/products/the-pomodoro-technique-book-us-edition) 
written by the creator.

If possible, consider buying the book from a local book-store.
