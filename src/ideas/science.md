One way in which you can make a contribution is by labelling. You can help
[mozilla](mozilla.org/) to teach robots [how to speak](https://voice.mozilla.org/en) or
[openstreetmaps](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=8/52.154/5.295) 
by helping them label [your neighborhood](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/StreetComplete). You can also help universities in general via the [zooniverse project](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects).

Another way to help is to offer your computers resources to perform complicated 
computations. Projects like [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/) allow 
you to help with calculating how protein structures fold (which is helping the fight
against many diseases like corona).
