It's a great excuse to learn some photoshop skills or to learn
how to do some digital video editing. There's some great examples
on the internet; there's a couple who demonstrates how to use a 
[green screen with a cat](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpLQXR116cLVUa1LRY8KS4w), a collection of 
[photoshopped cat faces](https://imgur.com/gallery/dl0WxHv), 
[dogs that look like food](https://www.boredpanda.com/dogs-food-funny-photoshop-edits-dogs-infood/), an owner
masking his dog [unto famous people](https://www.boredpanda.com/dog-photoshopped-famous-photos-shiba-inu/) or this man who
turns his dog into a [giant](https://www.boredpanda.com/giant-dog-photoshop-adventures-juji-christopher-cline/). 
You can also keep it simple and just
record [how animals react to objects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XID_W4neJo).

There's many ways to make your pets famous. Just make sure that 
whatever you do with your pets, they enjoy it too.
