It's time to clean out your digital repository of photos taken over the years and create a (physical) photo album. You can create one digitally and have it printed (e.g. here's a Dutch [supplier](https://foto.hema.nl/fotoboek-maken/)) or select and print your favourite memories and cut & paste them in a physical photobooklet yourself.

Be creative but also think back. What are your most important memories?
