You can try it with different designs white to black, or go crazy by going for a rainbow. The effects can be [amazing](https://www.google.com/search?q=bookshelf+sorted+by+color&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjO9uqrrOPsAhXQqaQKHSvMC3YQ_AUoAXoECBYQAw&biw=963&bih=1070&dpr=1.25). It doesn't just have to be books though. Adding order to your selves can cause a lot of calm. Another fun example is [this youtuber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFHqDcu88bg) who is sorting nail polish.
